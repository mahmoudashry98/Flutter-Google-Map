# Flutter Google Maps Live Tracking App

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Flutter application that integrates Google Maps for real-time tracking purposes. It allows users to visualize specific areas they have access to, marked by circles on the map, and places markers for various points of interest. Additionally, the app offers functionality to calculate and display the fastest routes to these points, facilitating easier navigation.

## Features
- **Live Tracking:** Real-time location tracking to monitor movements on the map.
- **Access Zones:** Defined areas on the map indicating regions of access, marked by circles.
- **Markers:** Customizable markers to highlight points of interest or locations on the map.
- **Fastest Route Calculation:** Algorithm to determine and display the quickest routes to a selected destination.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter installed on your system (see [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for installation guide).
- An active Google Maps API key (refer to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to obtain an API key).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/mahmoudashry98/Flutter-Google-Map.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   https://github.com/mahmoudashry98/Flutter-Google-Map

3. Install the required dependencies:

   1 * dio: ^5.4.1

   3 * google_maps_flutter: ^2.6.0
   4 * location: ^5.0.3
   5 * uuid: ^4.3.3


## Usage
- Open the app, and give the necessary permissions for location access.
- The live tracking feature starts automatically, showing your current location moving on the map in real-time.
- To view accessible areas, look for circles on the map. These areas are predefined and indicate zones you can access.
- Use the search function or tap on the map to place markers for specific locations you wish to explore.
- For directions, select your destination by tapping on a marker or searching. The app will calculate and display the fastest route to your selected destination.
